### Project Description
* The game is a mixture of Tic-Tac-Toe and Darts, here the goal is to get control of 3 bullseye in a row, like Tic-Tac-Toe.
* However, the twist is that a player can get control of his opponent's bullseye by aiming it closer to the center.
* I have implemented an Aiming mechanism using automatic locking of a target and using a power slider.
* For a more descriptive explanation of the project kindly check out the Project Abstract in this repository.
